## Overview

Cytopath-AI is a state-of-the-art AI-powered system for automated cervical cancer screening through cytological smear analysis. Built on advanced deep learning techniques, it assists cytopathologists in detecting and classifying cervical lesions according to the Bethesda System (TBS), significantly improving screening efficiency and accuracy.
